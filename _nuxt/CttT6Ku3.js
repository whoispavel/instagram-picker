In contrast, CPM calculates the cost per 1,000 impressions, where advertisers pay based on how many times their ad is displayed, regardless of user interaction. CPM is best suited for brand awareness campaigns, aiming to maximize visibility rather than direct engagement. The choice between CPC and CPM depends on whether the primary goal is user engagement or broader ad exposure."},{question:"What Are the Differences Between Manual and Automated Bidding Strategies in Google Ads?",answer:"Manual and automated bidding strategies in Google Ads offer different levels of control and optimization.

This approach is ideal for advertisers who want to closely manage their budgets and have a hands-on approach to campaign optimization. Automated bidding, on the other hand, uses Google’s algorithms to adjust bids automatically based on campaign goals, such as maximizing conversions, clicks, or return on ad spend (ROAS). Automated bidding saves time and leverages machine learning to optimize bids in real-time, ensuring your ads perform efficiently.
