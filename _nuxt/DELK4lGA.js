When you create an ad, it enters an auction where it competes with other Instagram ads trying to reach the same audience. In the end, you pay a <strong>cost per result.</strong></p><p>The price you pay for Instagram ads is influenced by <strong>three key factors:</strong> the competition level in the auction, the value users are likely to get from your ad, and the estimated action rate (the likelihood that users will interact with your ad).</p><p>Facebook considers these factors to decide <strong>which Instagram ads to show</strong> and <strong>at what Instagram ads cost</strong>, ensuring that users see relevant, high-quality content while advertisers can reach their target audiences efficiently. This system allows <strong>the cost of advertising on Instagram</strong> to change widely based on demand, ad quality, and engagement potential.

With this formula, you can understand how much Instagram advertising costs.</p><p>Even if an ad has a lower bid, a high Estimated Action Rate and User Value can help it outperform ads with higher bids, rewarding quality and relevance.

An impression is counted each time the ad is shown to a user, regardless of whether they interact with it.</p><p>Instagram ad <strong>Cost per Impression</strong> is one of the most common pricing models for Instagram ads, especially for campaigns focused on <strong>brand awareness, reach</strong>, or broad audience exposure. However, some advertisers may also focus on <a href="https://www.wask.co/instagram-advertising-costs/cpc-cost-per-click"><strong>Instagram Ads CPC</strong></a> to optimize their budget based on clicks rather than impressions.</p><p><strong>CPM for Instagram ads</strong> is calculated by dividing the total cost of the ad by the number of impressions and then multiplying by 1,000. The <strong>formula</strong> looks like this:</p><p><strong>CPM = (Total Cost / Impressions) × 1,000
</strong></p><p>Several factors influence CPM in Instagram ads, including audience targeting, ad quality, placement, and competition. Higher competition in your targeted audience or ad placement often results in <strong>a higher Cost per Impression</strong> on Instagram.</p><p>Additionally, ad quality and relevance affect the Instagram ads cost; ads that Facebook expects to perform well may achieve <strong>a lower CPM</strong> due to Facebook's auction system, which rewards relevant and engaging content.</p>`},{title:"How Much Does Instagram Ads' Average Cost per Impression?",description1:"<p>The <strong> average Instagram Cost Per Mille (CPM)</strong> can change significantly based on factors such as industry, audience targeting, ad placement, and seasonality.
